# Modelling-Sustainable-Fisheries ðŸŒŠðŸŽ£  
*FIT3139 Final Project by Snehar Singh Gujral (2025)*

> An **agent-based model** coupling an **Iterated Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma** fleet strategy with a **five-zone Markov-chain** tuna migration to explore over-fishing in Himalayan reservoirs.  
> The work evaluates skittish-fish behaviour, spatial chokepoints and territorial vs follower fleets across 100+ Monte-Carlo runs.

Growing up fishing in Himachal Pradesh, I wondered **which management levers actually keep stocks like the Golden Mahseer alive?**  
This project turns that question into code by:

* Modelling fish migration as a **discrete-time Markov chain** over five depth-linked zones.  
* Representing each fishing boat as an **agent** choosing *cooperate* (respect quotas) or *defect* (over-fish) in an **Iterated Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma**.  
* Introducing a **skittishness parameter Î±** so fish flee crowded zones.  
* Running **Monte-Carlo simulations** to quantify biomass, profit, and conflict hot-spots.

Please find the in-depth analysis in the Report.
